Create a guide for the `Model` module from `@effect/sql` package, in the file `src/Model.md`.

The guide must include:

- Clear problem / solution pattern
- 60 - 70% code examples
  - Code examples should be written in .ts files, and added to the .md guide once they have no type errors. Use `pnpm check` to check for type errors
- Progressive complexity
- Real world use cases

You should use the `effect_doc_search` tool as an authoritive source for effect documentation.

You can also use the effect source code from `effect/` as a reference.
